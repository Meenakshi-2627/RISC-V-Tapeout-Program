# Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

You can learn the fundamentals of digital design verification using open-source tools and simulation methodologies.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with Verilog RTL design and synthesis, ensure the following tools are installed:

- You have a Linux environment (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended).
- Icarus Verilog simulator is installed and accessible.
- GTKWave waveform viewer is configured.
- Basic understanding of digital logic concepts.

>**Note**
>If you're using Windows, consider setting up a virtual machine with Ubuntu or using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for better compatibility with open-source EDA tools.

# Introduction to Open-Source Simulator: iverilog

### <u>Simulator</u>

A **simulator** is a software tool that mimics the behavior of digital circuits by executing Verilog code and tracking signal changes over time.

Key characteristics of simulators include:

- **Change Detection**: Simulator monitors input signals and triggers output evaluation only when inputs change.
- **Event-Driven Operation**: No change in input signals results in no change in output signals.
- **Stimulus Application**: The simulator applies stimulus (set of test signals) to the design to test its behavior.
- **Temporal Tracking**: Monitors signal values across simulation time to verify design behavior.

### Design

A **design** is the actual Verilog module that implements the intended digital functionality and contains primary inputs and outputs.

### Testbench

A **testbench** is a specialized Verilog module that creates a controlled environment to test and verify your design's functionality.

Testbench characteristics:

- **No Primary I/O**: Testbenches have no primary inputs or outputs - they generate everything internally.
- **Stimulus Generation**: Creates and applies various input combinations to exercise the design.
- **Design Instantiation**: Contains an instance of the Design Under Test (DUT).
- **Response Monitoring**: Observes and verifies the design's outputs against expected behavior.

## iverilog-Based Simulation Flow

The iverilog simulation process transforms Verilog code into visual waveform analysis through a systematic workflow.

### Simulation Process

1. **Compilation**: Combine design and testbench files using iverilog compiler.
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled simulation using VVP (Verilog VPI).
3. **Waveform Generation**: Create VCD files for signal analysis.
4. **Visualization**: View results using GTKWave waveform viewer.

### Key Components

#### VCD File (Value Change Dump)
VCD files are industry-standard simulation dump files that record every signal transition during simulation.

#### GTKWave
GTKWave is a waveform viewer that transforms VCD data into interactive signal plots for design analysis and debugging.
